This is a beginner-friendly project where I created a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when done. It's a great starting point for learning web development fundamentals and practicing basic DOM manipulation. Check it out on GitHub!
